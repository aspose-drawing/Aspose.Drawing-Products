Files with the extension .PNG denotes raster Bitmap Image files, which serve as containers for storing bitmap digital images. These images can be opened across multiple platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Mac, and Linux. The PNG file format supports the storage of data as two-dimensional digital images in both monochrome and color formats, offering flexibility in color depth configurations.
