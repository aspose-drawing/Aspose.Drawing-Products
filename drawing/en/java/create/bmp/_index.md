Files with the extension .BMP denotes raster Bitmap Image files, which serve as containers for storing bitmap digital images. These images can be opened across multiple platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Mac, and Linux. The BMP file format supports the storage of data as two-dimensional digital images in both monochrome and color formats, offering flexibility in color depth configurations.
